# Project Instructions

This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

## Getting started

Please run `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary packages
Afterwards there are 4 commands that can be used:

`npm run build-prod`: creates dist folder for server
`npm run build-dev`: starts a dev server
`npm run test`: runs jest tests
`npm run start`: starts the node server

## To Use

After you build the project by running `npm run build-prod` and server is started by `npm run start` you can access the page using `localhost:8080`
Copy and paste any url of an article and it will produce an analysis report.
